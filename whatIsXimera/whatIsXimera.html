</p></div>   <div class="maketitle"></div>
<a href="http://ximera.osu.edu">Ximera</a> is an open-source software project that seeks to help course instructors create
learning materials for their students in the form of interactive web pages and high
quality PDF documents. Our strategy to achieve this goal is to separate content from
deployment.
<!--l. 17--><p class="noindent" >An author writes content as a <span class="LATEX">L<span class="A">A</span><span class="TEX">T<span 
class="E">E</span>X</span></span> document. This produces a PDF handout
that can be distributed to students. Next the author uploads the same <span class="LATEX">L<span class="A">A</span><span class="TEX">T<span 
class="E">E</span>X</span></span> file
to <a href="http://github.com">github.com</a>, a free web-based service providing a number of features to developers
and authors. In turn <a href="http://github.com">github.com</a> delivers the file to the <a href="http://ximera.osu.edu">Ximera</a> interpreter, which
posts the file on the web. The web page has essentially the same content as the
handout. However, the web page typically has interactive features not possible in the
handout due to the physical limitations of paper. For example, the web
page might pose a question that if answered incorrectly, would offer hints or
further questions to the student. This process is illustrated in the figure
below.

<h4 class="subsectionHead"><a 
 id="x1-1000"></a>Benefits of Ximera</h4>
<!--l. 36--><p class="noindent" >One benefit of <a href="http://ximera.osu.edu">Ximera</a> is that it provides an easy way to produce interactive online
materials. Another benefit is that many educators, particularly mathematicians, are
already quite familiar with <span class="LATEX">L<span class="A">A</span><span class="TEX">T<span 
class="E">E</span>X</span></span> and even find it easy to use. And because the
<span class="TEX">T<span 
class="E">E</span>X</span> language is extremely static in comparison with other programming and
markup languages, authors can expect the <a href="http://ximera.osu.edu">Ximera</a> materials they create to be usable
in some form for the foreseeable future.

<h4 class="subsectionHead"><a 
 id="x1-2000"></a>Differences between Ximera and Learning Management Systems</h4>
<!--l. 46--><p class="noindent" >A Learning Management System (LMS) such as Blackboard or Moodle provides
students with a central webpage from which they can navigate to the webpage of
each of their courses, these course web pages all formatted and laid out in
exactly the same way. Because of the possibility of conveying grades to
                                                                  

                                                                  
students, an LMS requires students and instructors to have accounts, which are
typically set up by the college or University, as are the course web pages
themselves.
</p><!--l. 54--><p class="noindent" >By far, the most common way to use an LMS in our experience is to make
announcements or to distribute files to students. While this could be accomplished
through email or simple web pages, the LMS, being largely set up by the
college or University, provides an even easier way to distribute files and
communicate with students. It also organizes students&#x2019; course materials in a single
location.
</p><!--l. 61--><p class="noindent" >The function of an LMS most relevant to our discussion of <a href="http://ximera.osu.edu">Ximera</a> is assessment.
Instructors compose quizzes or homework assignments, which consist of
sequences of questions of various types. Typically each question has a unique
answer, allowing the LMS to score the assignment and record grades in a
gradebook, another function of an LMS. It should be born in mind that
composing questions for an LMS, particularly multiple-choice questions,
creates a lot of work for instructors. For this reason textbook publishers
are increasingly bundling their books with accounts on proprietary LMS&#x2019;s,
from which an instructor can select precomposed exercises for students to
complete.
</p><!--l. 73--><p class="noindent" >In contrast <a href="http://ximera.osu.edu">Ximera</a> provides a more flexible environment for creating course
materials. While an activity on an LSM consists solely of a sequence of problems, a
<a href="http://ximera.osu.edu">Ximera</a> activity can contain whatever content a <span class="LATEX">L<span class="A">A</span><span class="TEX">T<span 
class="E">E</span>X</span></span> document can contain, and
in addition, can include interactive questions of various types.
</p>
<h4 class="subsectionHead"><a 
 id="x1-3000"></a>Ways Ximera can be used</h4>
<!--l. 81--><p class="noindent" >Whereas an LMS typically only supplements a traditional course, an entire course
can be delivered through <a href="http://ximera.osu.edu">Ximera</a>. For example, a course could consist of a
sequence of <a href="http://ximera.osu.edu">Ximera</a> activities, each of which primarily composed of text
for students to read, with an occasional question sprinkled in to confirm
and deepen students&#x2019; understanding of the material presented just before
the question. More substantial questions could appear at the end of the
activity.
</p><!--l. 91--><p class="noindent" >Another possibility is to use <a href="http://ximera.osu.edu">Ximera</a> in conjunction with a traditional lecture-based
course, using <a href="http://ximera.osu.edu">Ximera</a> to deliver pre-lecture reading materials and exercises to be
completed by students before arriving to their lecture. These could serve as a prelude
to the lecture, perhaps presenting background topics or materials to review before the
lecture.
</p><!--l. 99--><p class="noindent" >The emphasis of <a href="http://ximera.osu.edu">Ximera</a> is more on content delivery than on assessment. We
understand however that many students function better knowing that their actions
will be acknowledged by their instructors. We therefore envisage providing ways for
instructors to access student scores on <a href="http://ximera.osu.edu">Ximera</a> activities in the near future. In the
meantime it might be better to use a traditional LMS to deliver exercises if keeping
                                                                  

                                                                  
track of student participation is important.
