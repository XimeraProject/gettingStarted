SAGE Math Cloud is the easist way for a new author to publish.
\end{abstract}
\maketitle

To publish your work to the internet, you will need a computer that
can run our tools. The developers of Ximera use \link[Arch Linux]{http://www.archlinux.org/}, but we belive that to be too difficult for the average user. Instead, we suggest you use \link[SAGE]{http://cloud.sagemath.com/}.

Once you have a SAGE accound, you will need to start a new project

And when you create this new project, give it a Title, and a
Description. This project \textbf{must} have internet access.

Now when you click on files, a terminal will be one of your options.

Click on the terminal and type

\begin{verbatim}
curl https://ximera.osu.edu/install.sh | bash
\end{verbatim}
to install an environment that has the required tools (like the Ximera
class file, the `xake' build tool to compile and publish to the
server, and mutool for rasterizing graphics).
